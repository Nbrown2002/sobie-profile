Facilitator: Dr. Barry Cumbie

## Purpose ##
The creation of this profile is to display a personal
profile for Noah Brown working at Sobie Inc. This profile is 
secure and is only accessible by utilizing a .env variable with a 
specific password. This password utilizes a specific encryption method. 

### Additional Features ###
Inside the profile, there is a way to display data from a MongoDB 
database and allow it to be altered in the profile itself. It should 
be able to both create and delete different entries. It also contains a nav-bar 
that allows the viewer to be able to navigate to the repo and the render application.
